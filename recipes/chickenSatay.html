    <h3>For Servings</h3>

        <li>1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>lime wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For marinade, combine curry paste, curry powder, salt, white sugar, brown sugar, fish sauce, and coconut milk in a bowl. Stir until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut chicken thighs into approximately 1-inch pieces, and transfer into the marinade. Mix thoroughly, then wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight before grilling. </li>
        <li>For peanut sauce, add peanut butter, coconut milk, garlic, brown sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil, and Sriracha to a bowl and whisk thoroughly together. Add water if desired to thin the sauce. Taste for seasoning, and adjust if necessary. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before using.</li>
        <li>Once chicken is marinated, skewer chicken pieces on bamboo so that the meat is touching, but not pressed tightly together.</li>
        <li>Prepare a charcoal grill. Charcoal should be ashy white and very hot. Brush the grates lightly with oil.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken over charcoal until chicken firms up and springs back to the touch, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
